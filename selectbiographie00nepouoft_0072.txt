68 CORNELIUS NEPOS.

first campaign was under Fabius Maximus in Campania
against Hannibal (214 B.C.). He was also with the same com-
mander at the siege of Tarentum in 209. The battle of the
Metaurus was in 207. His political career began with the
quaestorship in 204. He was plebeian aedile in 199, praetor
in 198, and consul in 195. His provincia as consul was Hither
Spain, where he distinguished himself by crushing rebellion
and settling the affairs of the country. He dealt justly by

taxing costly slaves, statues, pictures, carriages, and luxurious
clothing3 but, like most sumptuary edicts, Cato's did not
rem-ain long in force. It was in dealing with the provinces
that Cato’s good qualities were most noticeable. Though
thoi-oughly Roman in his ideas, he had a strong sense of justice,
and no man did more to keep in check the misgovernment of
the provinces. He also interfered to save the independence
of the state of Rhodes, which had offended the Romans by
attempting to mediate between them and Perseus, the last
king of Macedon.

But for those whom he regarded as dangerous to Rome he
had no mercy, and it was his voice that urged on his country-
