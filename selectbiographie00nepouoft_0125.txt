ΧΙ. CIMON.

Cimon was more like the ideal knight of the middle ages
than perhaps any other character of Grecian history. He
was brave, courteous, aud generous. Nepos makes his usual
mistake about the meaning of ostracism when he says that
Cimon was ostracized because he became unpopular like his
father. It was really because the rivalry between Cimon
and Pericles was so great that in the interest of the state one
of them had to go. Nepos omits the facts that it was Cimon
who induced the Athenians to send help to Sparta, when she
was struggling against the Helots who had revolted; that he
led the troops sent; and that he lost his popularity because
the Athenian force was unceremoniously dismissed. Plutarch
tells us that when the Athenians marched against the
Peloponnesian army, which threatened to invade Attica in
457, Cimon asked in vain to be allowed to fight in the ranks
of his tribe; and that, when this· was refused, his personal
friends took Cimon's armoni· into the battle and fought and
died round it. This made such an impression th‘at Pericles
himself proposed and carried the repeal of the ostiacism, and
Cimon returned to Athens. Thenceforth Cimon left politics
to Pericles, and contented himself with leading expeditions
against the Persians.

eius litem aestimatam populo solvere non potuisset ob
eamque causam in vinclis publicis decessisset, Cimon
eadem custodia tenebatur neque legibus Atheniensium
emitti poterat, nisi pecuniam, qua pater multatus erat,
solvisset. Habebat autem in matrimonio sororem ger-
manam suam, nomine Elpinicen, non magis amore qnam
more ductus: namque Atheniensibus licet eodem patre
natas uxores ducere. Huius coniugii cupidus Callias
quidam, non tam generosus quam pecuniosus, qui
magnas pecunias ex metallis fecerat, egit cnm Cimone
ut eam sibi uxorem daret: id si impetrasset, se pro illo
pecuniam soluturum. Is cum talem condicionem asper·
