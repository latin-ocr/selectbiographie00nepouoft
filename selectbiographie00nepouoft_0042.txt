occasion and refusing all his requests. Lysander was at last
glad to be sent away on a special mission to the Hellespont.
In :394 Rc. broke out the war between Sparta on one side, and
Thebes Athens, Corinth, and Argos on the other, known as
the Corinthian war. Lysander was sent into Boeotia with
a small force. He was to be joined by a larger one under
King PausaniaS, and the combined armies were to attack
Haliartus on a certain day. As the king did not keep tryst,
Lysander advanced without him, was surprised by a sudden
sally from the town, defeated, and slain. His death was a
distinct gain to the Greek world, for no member of it combined
to an equal extent the power and the will to do harm.

neque, id qua ratione consecutus sit, latet. Non enim
virtute sui exereitus, sed immodestia factum est adver-
sariorum, qui, quod dicto audientes imperatoribus suis
non erant, dispalati in agris relictis navibus, in hostium
venei-unt potestatem. Quo facto Athenienses se Lace-
daemoniis dediderunt. Hac victoria Lysander elatus,
cum antea semper factiosus audaxque fuisset, sic sibi
indulsit, ut eius opera in maximum odium Graeciae
Lacedaemonii pervenerint. Nam cum hanc causam
Lacedaemonii dictitassent sibi esse belli, ut Athenienâ€”
sium impotentem dominationem refringerent, postquam
apud Aegos flumen Lysander classis hostium est potitus,
nihil aliud molitus est, quam ut omnes civitates in sua
teneret potestate, eum id se Lacedaemoniorum causa
facere simularet. Namque undique, qui Atheniensium
rebus studuissent, eiectis decem delegerat in unaquaque
civitate, quibus summum imperium potestatemque om-
nium rerum committeret. Horum in numerum nemo
admittebatur, nisi qui aut eius hospitio contineretur aut
se illius fore proprium fide confirmarat.
