mud; ‘that crisis ‘.

eius ordini83 the equestrian order. Gaius Gracchus in 123 had
established the ordo equester, admitting to it any Roman whose
grandfather was free born, who had a certain amount of property,
and who was not a senator. As soon as a man became a member of
the senate he ceased to be an eques. By a lex Sempronia of Gracchus
the judiees were chosen from the equites instead of from the senators.
Sulla did away with this arrangement, but in 70 B. c. the privilege
was divided between senators, equites, and tribuni aerarii (originally
the officers for collecting taxes from the tribes). Before the time
of Gracchus the equites were those whose position entitled them to
serve as cavalry, either with horse supplied by the state or with
those of their own, and there was no exclusion of senators from the
equites. But the equites had long ceased to serve as cavalry in war.
Caesar’s cavalry was composed of Gauls or Germans.

Brutum is the subject of usurum, se (Atticum) of collocu-
turum and coiturum ; another change of subject without notice.

provinciarum ; something seems to have dropped out; destituta
administratione has been suggested, ‘abandoning the performance
of the commission given them for form's sake by the consul ’
(Antony). It was a commission to buy corn for the use of Rome in

Asia and Sicily.
parti ; usually in plural, ‘party ’.

restituendi ; ‘of bringing him back ’.
litibus distineretur3 ‘was distracted by suits'.

tanta...Attico ; ‘he tendered his services so carefully that she did
not appear in court (lit. keep her bail) without Atticus, and Atticus
stood her surety for everything '.

cum illa...potuisset; ‘when during her prosperity she bought
a farm to be paid for by a certain day, and could not after her ill-
fortune raise the money by loan’.

cum faciebat; the indicative, because the tempora] clause does
not include the other, and there is therefore no idea of cause.

temporis causa; ‘to temporize '.

rerum ; ‘ would be master of the situation ’.

is stands for ille, i.e. Atticus.

videretur; the subj. as giving their reason for blaming him.
