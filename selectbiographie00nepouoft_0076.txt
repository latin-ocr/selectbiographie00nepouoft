72 CORNELms NEPOS.

close connection with Athens and his great knowledge of Attio
Greek gained him the surname of Atticus. His principles
were Epicurean, that is to say, he regarded happiness, which
was the aim of life, to consist in refined pleasure. Epicurus
demanded for a happy life not the most exquisite pleasures;
he recommended, on the contrary, sobriety and temperance,
contentnient with little, and a life generally in accord with
enrture. F riendship was to him a chief means of happiness,
as the union of congenial nature& and as conferring a lasting
satisfaction which the joys of sense could not procure. In
Nepos we see how Atticus lived up to these doctrines, and
v how they made him the warm friend that he was. They also
account for his end. Epicurus taught that pain was to be
avoided unless it led to greater pleasure, and pleasure if it
brought pain3 that death was not an evil to be dreaded, for it
‘xx-as no evil not to live, and so the wise man feared not death.

In 65 Bc. Atticus returned to Rome. It was in a more
settled state to all appearance than when he left it twenty
years before, when Cinna was lord of Rome indeed, but expect-
ing the arrival of Sulla from the East, victorious and thirsting
,for vengeance. But there was danger under the surface. Cati-
line was plotting to overthrow the government and abolish
debt, Cn. Pompeius was shortly to return victorious from the
East like Sulla, and with an army mightier than Sulla's, and
·no one knew how he would use or abuse his power. Atticus
,lived on through the stormy times which followed, saw Cicero
consul and Catiline crushed, and watched the gradual decay of
the power of Pompeius and the rise of that of Caesar ; he lived
on to witness the extinction of the free Roman Repubhc, to
survive the violent death of his dearest friends, whom even he
could not save, and to be as intimate with Augustus as he had
been with Cicero.

Atticus married in 56 Bc. a lady named Pilia. She was a
friend of Cicero's wife Terentia, and we hear of Cicero lending
her his Cuman villa on the shore of the Lucrine lake when she
wished to stay in the country, and giving her the key of his
cellar. Though Nepos says that Atticus lived on the produce
of his estates, we learn from Cicero's letters that he bought
