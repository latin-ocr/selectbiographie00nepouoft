PAUSANIAS.
XI.

(l) Pausanias, having defeated the Medes at Plataea, was
so elated that he placed a golden tripod at Delphi in which
he claimed for himself the glory of that victory. (Ξ) He als01‚
having stormed Byzantium, sent back to Xerxes some Persian
nobles whom he had taken there. (3) With whom he sent
a letter in which he had written that he wished to marry the
king's daughter, and that he would reduce all Greece under
his-2 power. (4) The Lacedaemonians, suspecting his treachery,
sent for him and accused him of treason, but acquitted him.
(5) Pausanias, though he was not sent back by the govern-
mentss, returned to Asia of his own accord, and again sent
letters to the king. (6) Summoned again to Sparta, and
thrown into prison, he did not so clear himself as to be free

from all suspicion.

(l) Pausanias, while remaining at Sparta, tried to tamper
with the Helots, the slaves of the Lacedaemonians. (2) Yet
the ephors would not punish him till they received1 a certain
proof of his crime. (3) It happened that a slave of Pausanias
having opened a letter which he2 had given him for³ the king,
found that he would be condemned to4 death 5 when he had
come⁶ to the king. (4) By the advice of the ephors he took
refuge in the temple of Neptune, which is at Taenarum. (5)
The ephors being concealed there, Pausanias visited the slave,
and in their hearing⁷ asked him why he had fied thither.
(6) When the slave had told him what he had read ⁸ in the
letter, Pausanias begged him to grant him pardon.
