(1) Aristides, having contended1 with Themistocles for the
leadership‚ was banished for ten years. (2) But he was re-
called before undergoing the whole penalty. (3) He was
present at the battles of 2 Salamis and Plataea. (4) At Salamis
he brought word to the Greeks that they were surrounded by
the Persians. (5) He also3 commanded the Athenians, who
landed on the island of Psyttalia and killed the Persians
stationed there. (6) When Pausanias offended the allies by

money each state should give to carry on war with the bar—

wards was transferred to Athens. (3) From this arose the
empire of the Athenians3 for when the allies were unwilling
to contribute money and shipS, they forced them to1 pay what
was demanded. (4) Aristides, though2 he might have become
very rich, died so poor that he was carried to the grave with
a mean funeral. (5) Yet the Athenians were not so unmind-
ful of him but that they reared his daughters at the expense
of the statess. (6) The most eloquent of the Athenians died
rich in exile, the most just poor in his own land.
