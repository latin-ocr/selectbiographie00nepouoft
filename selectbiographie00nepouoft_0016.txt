despot strengthened his position by taking mercenary troops
into his pay and by marrying a Thracian princess. In 516
he, with several other Grecian despots, from the islands of
the Aegean or the coast towns of Asia, accompanied Darius
on his Scythian expedition. That is to say, they were in com·
mand of the fleet which had orders to sail two days up the
Danube and throw a bridge over it for the Persian army to
cross. Then followed the episode of Miltiades advising the
other Greeks to break down the bridge, and his having to

by Nepos. Nepos, however, does not mention, what Hero-

this event. putting it before the Scythian expedition of Darius,
and his statement that there was no resistance is at variance
with that of Herodotus. On the suppression of the Ionic
revolt, Miltiades was obliged to leave the Chersonese for ever.
So liotly was he pursued that the Phoenician fleet captured
one of his ships with his son Metiochus on board. Miltiades
himself got¹ safe to Athens, where he was received with
iningled feelings; but his services in the capture of Lemnos
counterbalanced the ill-will with which the ex-despot was
regarded in demon-ratic Athens. He was tried before the
popular assernbly for his despotism, but acquitted3 and such
was the belief in his ability that be was one of the ten generals
elected for the year 490, when the Persian invasion was close
at hand. The credit of the victory at Marathon rests with
Miltiades, who commanded in chief with the consent of his
eolleagues, who gave up to hini their days of command when
the casting-vote of the poleinarch had been given for imme-
diate battle. For five of the generals had wished to wait the
