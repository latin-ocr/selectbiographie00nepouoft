Agesilaus was morally as superior to Lysander as he was
inferior to Brasidas and CallicratidaS, the two really great
men whom the war produced, and who, while good Spartans,
had a high idea of what was due to other Greeks. Callicratidas
refused to sell Greeks into slavery‚ and Brasidas treated the
Helots who served under him as if they were Spartans of the
ruling caste. But Agesilaus, though he is credited with re-
fusing to destroy Corinth, and did carry on war against the
Persians in defence of the Greek cities of Asia, would have
blotted out Thebes if he had had the power, and in the inter-
est of Sparta called in the Persian king to arbitrate between
the Greeks in Europe. He even agreed to hand over to him
the very cities to secure whose freedom he had fought for two
years. Again, though proof against bribes himself, Agesilaus
was unscrupulous in the means he employed to render services
to his friends. In this respect, as in others, he was inferior
to his great opponent Epaminondas.

eo enim usus est familiarissime. Hic primum de regno

duabus familiis Procli et Eurysthenis, qui principes ex
progenie Herculis Spartae reges fuerunt. Horum ex
altera in alterius familiae locum fieri non licebat. Ita
utraque suum retinebat ordinem. Primum ratio habe-
batur, qui maximus natu esset ex liberis eiuS, qui regnans
decessisset 3 sin is virilem sexum non reliquisset, tum ‹leli-
gebatur, qui proximus esset propinquitate. Mortuus erat
Agis rex, frater Agesilai. Filium reliquerat Leotychidem,
quem ille natum non agnorat; eundem moriens suum esse
dixerat. Is de honore regni cum Agesila0‚ patruo suo,
contendit neque id, quod petivit, consecutus est. Nam
Lysandro suffragante, homine, ut ostendimus supra,
