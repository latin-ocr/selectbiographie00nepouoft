MILTIADES.

I.

(1) Miltiades, an Athenian noble, was sent by Hippias,
tyrant of Athens to rule1 the Chersonese. (2) While sailing2
thither he touched at Lemnos and wished to subject the
Lemnians to the authority of Athens. (3) The Lemnians said
mockingly that they would do so, when he, sailing from
home, reached Lemnos with a north wind. (4) After several
years he sailed to Lemnos from the Chersonese and demanded
that they should surrender3, because he had his home in the
Chersonese. (5) Accordingly the Lemnians, not daring to
resist, emigrated. (6) But, some years4 before, Darius, king
of Persia, made war on the Scythians.

II.

(1) Darius, having made a bridge over¹ the Danube, led
his army across, and left Miltiades, with other rulers of Greek
cities, to guard the bridge. (2) Since the king was long absent,
Miltiades advised the rulers to2 break down the bridge. (3)
For he said, that if they did3 this they would free Greece.
(4) But Histiaeus, the Milesian, said that if they did this,
they themselves would be driven from power. (5) The other
chiefs followed the advice of Histiaeus. (6) Wherefore Milti-
ades determined to leave the Chersonese and return to Athens.
