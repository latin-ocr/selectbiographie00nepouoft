50 CORNELIUS NEPOS.

inasmuch as in return for his services to the Spartans in
the Peloponnesian war they had laid his country waste and
destroyed his residences and hunting grounds. Agesilaus
answered that he made war upon him as a subject of the
Persian king, and offered to make him independent of that
monarch. When Pharnabazus refused to be disloyal to his
master, Agesilaus expressed great admiration for him, and
promised not to attack him so long as there were any other
Persians to fight. Then followed an Homeric interchange of
gifts between the son of Pharnabazus ancl Agesilaus. Xeno-
phon adds that subsequently the young Persian, having been
driven from home, was kindly received in Greece by Agesilaus,
and that the latter used his intluence in favour of a boy-friend
of the son of Pharnabazus. This boy desired to enter for the
boys’ race at the Olympio gameS, but was not qualified by
reason of his age. Agesilaus, however, induced the judges to
let him run.

Both Xenophon and his imitator Nepos praise Agesilaus
for his returning to Greece in 394 Bc, instead of remaining at
the head of his army in Asia, in obedience to the order of the
ephors. But the fact is, that a Spartan king had no choice in
the matter, and was bound to obey the authorities at home.
Nepos carries his admiration to the height of absurdity when
he speaks of the speed with which Agesilaus marched from
Asia to Boeotia in a month, as contrasted with Xerxes, who
took a year to do the same march. He forgets that the army
of Xerxes was at least a hundred times as numerous as that
of Agesilaus.

In his account of the battle of Coronea Nepos does not
mention, as Xenophon does, that the Theban phalanx cut its
way through that commanded by Agesilaus Nepos as usual,
confuses his order of events, He speaks of Agesilaus as being
present at the battle of Corinth and killing 1o‚000 of the
enemy, whereas this battle was fought before the return of
Agesilaus from Asia. Nepos probably co'nfounds it with what
was called the “tearless battle '’, in 368 B.c., between the
Spartans and the ArcadianS, in which the latter are said to
have lost 10,000 men and the Spartans none.
