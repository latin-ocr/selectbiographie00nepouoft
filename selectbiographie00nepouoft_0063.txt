HANNIBAL. 59

not, as Nepos says, prepare to continue the war, but per1
suaded his countrymen to make peace. For the next nine
years he was practically master of Carthage, and reformed
the narrow oligarchy which had been its ruin.

In 193 B.c. he was driven from Carthage to avoid being
surrendered to the Romans, and went to Antiochus of Syria.
The plan of campaign which he wished that king to adopt
was that he himself should be sent with a small force to ronse
Carthage once more against Rome, and to cross over to Italy,
while Antiochus advanced thither across Greece. The battle
of Magnesia, which took place in 191 B.c., forced Hannibal
to leave Syria. He died at Libyssa, in Bithynia, about
182 13.c.

Nepos has plenty of praise for the ability of Hannibal, both
as a general and as a statesman. We could wish that he had
given more details as to his character. He says nothing, for
instance, about his influence over other men, which made him
the most wonderful general of a host of mercenaries of differ-
ent nations that the world has ever seen.

1. HANNIBAL, Hamilcaris filius, Carthaginiensis. Si
verum est, quod nemo dubitat, ut populus Romanus
omnes gentes virtute supera-rit, non est infitiandum Han-
nibalem tanto praestitisse ceteros imperatores prudentia,
quanto populus Romanus antecedat fortitudine cunctas
nationes. Nam quotiescumque cum eo congressus est in
Italia, semper discessit superior. Quod nisi <lomi civium
suorum invidia debilitatus esset, Romanos videtur supe-
rare potuisse. Sed multorum obtrectatio devicit unius
virtutem.

Hic autem velut hereditate relictum odium paternum
erga Romanos sic conservavit, ut prins animam quam
id deposuerit, qui quidem, cum patria pulsus esset et
alienarum opum indigeret, numquam destiterit animo
bellare cum Romanis
