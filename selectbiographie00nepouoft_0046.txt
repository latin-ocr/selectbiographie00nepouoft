42 consumes NEPOS.

Peloponnese‚ marched through Laconia though repulsed at
Sparta, restored the independence of Messenia, which had
been subject to Sparta sor three centuries, and founded in
Arcadia a centra! city called Megalopolis. By thece mensures
the power of Sparta in the Peloponnese was permanently
weakened. It was on this occasion that Epaminondae exceeded
his term of command and was brought to trial, but ac-
quitted on his return to Thebes, as Nepos relntes. In 369 Re.
he invaded the l'eloponnese the second time, forcing the
μευ-ωας of the Isthmus, defended by a joint Athenian and
huffe-daemonnm anny, but aoeomplished nothing decisive. Iu
367 ης. he invaded Achaia and induced the Achaean citiee
to juin the 'flu—ban league, bnt as he had not made any change
of governt11e11t among them, he was met with blame on his
return home and was not re-elected boeotarch.

liis next vampaign accordingly was in the ranke of the anny
sent to rea-seue Pelopidas, who had been treacherouflly ΜΘΗ
pn‘mner by Alexander of Pherae. owing to the incom-
pet‹·n‹·e of the 'l'heban generals their army was beaten, and
would have been destroyed had not Epaminondas been called
by the soldiem to take command. He mnbeequently led
another army into '1'}1‹·⁸saly‚ and successfully nocomplished
the releane os his fm'end. In 36ss ac. he went as envoy to
A rmdia, as mentioned b>- Nepou, to try to keep the Arcadian·
from joining the Athenians, bnt without success. Three
,venno later he appeared in a new character, that of admiral of
n Tlneban ficet, in the Aegean, with the objectos breaking
the power of Athe-nn by nea, as be lund done that of Spu-tu by
land. ln 3652 he invaded the Peloponneso for the lut time,
and nster nn ineffectum! attempt to surprise Βριήι, fought an
action at Mantinea, in which he employed the nme metio·
ms nt Iouem, with the name succes, but fell him-dr in the
moment os victory.
