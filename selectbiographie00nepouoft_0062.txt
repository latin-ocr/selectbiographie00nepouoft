58 CORNELIUS NEPos.

Thither he was followed by Q. Fabius Maximus, appointed
dictator after the late defeat. Hannibal, after in vain offering
Fabius battle, moved into Samnium, and thence into Cam-
pania. It was there that Fabius tried to blockade him, and
was baffled by Hannibal's stratagem of the oxen. Then
followed the temporary success of Minucius, Master of the
Horse in the Roman army, during the absence of Fabius Í¾ the
consequent enthusiasm at Rome, which resulted in Minucius
being given equa] power with Fabius3 and the subsequent
engagement, in which Minucius and his army were only saved
by the support of Fabius, near Geronium in Northern Apulia.
. Nepos puts the dictatorship of Fabius after the battle of
Cannae, and antedates Hannibal's march upon Rome by five
years.

At Cannae (216 Bo), with 40,000 men, 10,000 of whom he
had to leave to guard his camp, Hannibal almost annihilated
the armies of the consuls Terentius Varro and Aemilius
Paulus. He did not advance upon Rome, for his army was
hardly large enough to blockade the town effectually in the
midst of a hostile population, and he seems to have had no
siege train. The chief result of the victory was that Capua,
the most important town in Italy after Rome, went over to
Hannibal. But Capua sent him no troops, and indeed
expected him to defend her against the Romans3 and with
the exception of the capture of the town of Tarentum (212
Bc), he gained no more important successes, but gradually
lost, while the Romans gained in strength. The Cartha-
ginians sent him little help, and his negotiations with Philip
of Macedon had small result. In 211 Capua was retaken by
the. Romans, in spite of Hannibal's marching upon Rome.

In 208 Bc. he killed the two consuls, Crispinus and Mar-
cellus, in an ambuscade3 but in 207 B.C. his brother, Has-
drubal, who came from Spain to join him in Italy, was
defeated and slain on the banks of the Metaurus in Umbria.
From that time till 203 he remained at bay among the
Bruttians in the extreme south of Italy. He was then
summoned back to Africa to defend Carthage, and at Zama
in 202 suffered defeat from P. Cornelius Scipio. He did
