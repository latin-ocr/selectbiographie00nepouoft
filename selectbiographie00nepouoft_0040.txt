Such a man was naturally the object of jealousy, especially
as Lysander was a poor man by birth. He was obnoxious to
the kings, who resented the way in which their power was
cui-tailed by the ephom, and could the less brook eminence in
one so inferior in birth. Accordingly his various enemies at
home and abroad combined against him. WVheu a comiter-
revolution against the Thirty Tyrants was beguu by Thrasy·
bulus, Lysander, who commanded the Lacedaemoniau force
sent against him, was suddenly superseded by King Pausanias,
and au arrangement was finally made by which the Athenian
democracy was restored (403 13.c.). This was the first check
which Lysander had received. Yet his influence was still

based on the religionis feeling of the Spartans and on the

brihe the orm-les of Delphi, Dodona, and Ammon in Libya.
But for once the orac-les were not to be corrupted, and the
prieats of Ammon even ‹lenounced the attempt at Sparta.
This scheme having failed, he tried another. There was in
one of the cities of the Euxine a youth named Silenus, a re·

pnted son of Apollo. The friends of Lysander niade known·

that there were some secret and inspired recorda at Delphi,
which could only be consulted b>- a son of the god. The idea
was that Silenus should go to Delphi, have his claim to
