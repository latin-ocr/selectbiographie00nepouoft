XVI.

(1) Epaminondas was the most famous general in¹ all

bribe him, was leaving2 Thebes he gave him an escort to take-³
him safely to Athens. (5) WVhen his detractor, Meneclides,
urged the Thebans to prefer peace to war, Epaminondas told

trained in war.

been put to death by the Thebans because he had⁴ compelled
them to conquer the Spartans. (6) On saying this he was
acquitted by the votes of all.
