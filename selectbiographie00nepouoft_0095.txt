Poecile3 the Greek πὸικίλη, ‘of different colours’, the work of
Polygnotus, about 462 B.C.

posteaquam regularly takes the perfect, like postquam, except
when the duration of the time is mentioned, and then the pluperfect
is found.

largitione; ‘ by largesses given by the magistrates ⁷. The same
expression occurs in Themistocles 2. Nepos means probably the pay
given for attendance at the Aaeembly, the Senate, and the Law
Courts, and the price of the free seats in the theatre.

The reasoning of Nepos as to the connection between the maius
imperium and the three hundred statues hardly holds good. The
Athenians had no imperium beyond Attica in the days of Demetrius
Phalereus.

Demetrius of Phalerum (Phalerum was the oldest harbour of
Athens) was put at the head of the Athenian Oligarchical party by
Cassander, Viceroy of Macedon, to govern in his interest (1317-307
B.c.) as despot. He seems to have goverued well, hut had to leave
Athens on the invasion of Demetrius Poliorcetes with a large army.

plerasque. This is not correct. Herodotus says that he merely
went to Paros. Later authorities say that he told the Athenians
he would bring over the other islands to them, and that he did
actually land on and ravage some of them. In his account of the
attack on Paros, Nepos follows Ephorus, an historian of the 4th
century B.c.

operibus; ‘lines ’.

vineis ac testudinibus. Nepos translates freely the μηχανήματα.
of Ephorus. Vineae were mox-able sheds, under cover of which
besiegers approached the walls. The testudo was formed by soldiers
loeking their shields together above their headS‚ so that the whole

was like the overlapping plates of a tortoise shell. The defences of
a batteringwam were called testudo arietaria.

in eo esset, ut; ‘ was about to '.

in continenti; another inaccuracy of Nepos. Ephorus says
that the fire was on the island of Myconus, north of Paros. It
would not have been possible to see from Paros a fire on the main·

, land of Asia.

rege; the Persian king, as in 5.
datum; supply esse.
