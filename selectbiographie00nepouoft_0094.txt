90 CORNELIUS NE'Pos.

ut nuntiaret; for the more usual qui nuntiaret, probably because
qui would have been too far from its antecedent Phidippum.

praetores; ‘ generals ’, the Roman equivalent for the Greek
στρατηγοὺς. There were ten of these elected every year, one from
each Athenian tribe. They commanded fleets and armies, but also
carried on the home government. Praetor was originally a military

title. So praetorium meant the headquarters even of a consul in
camp.

praeessent is imperf. because creant is an historic present, and
the action describeo is really past.

nitebatur3 ‘strongly urged that the camp should be pitched as
soon as possible '.

eor-um 3 for sua, because that might refer to Miltiades, the chief
subject of the sentence. ·

ἃυόθνῐ...άίηπί(;3.ῐ·ἰ : if an impersonal verb is used in the passive,
the infinitive depending on it is put in the passive also, ay. pte-qnare:
coeptum est.

5.

tempore; ‘crisis’.

Plataeenses. Plataea had shortly before received the protection
of Athens against Thebes.

Ea, zze. civitas Plataeensi& implied in Plataeenses.

mille militum ; mille is sometimes used like milia, as a noun.
non apertissu ma, with reyione; ‘somewhat broken ground’.
rarae 3 ‘scattered about '.

tractu, ‘line’.

venire nt3 subj., because this was his intention.

profligarint, perterruerint, petierint. Nepos is fond of the
perf. subj. in consecutive sentences, especially when the verb ex-
presses a consequence which is regarded as a single momentary
action, and not as an action repeated, or as a state.

6.

This chapter is borrowed from the speech of Aeschines in Ctesi·
phontem, in which he makes the same complaint- as to the lavish
distribution of honours in his day as contrasted with the past,
especially with what was conferred on Miltiades.

'The' orcl‘er is: Non alienum videtur docere quale praemium cuius
metonae, ⁷c.

ten ues ; ‘ unsubstantial ’.
With nunc supply sunt.
obsoleti 3 ‘worthless '.
