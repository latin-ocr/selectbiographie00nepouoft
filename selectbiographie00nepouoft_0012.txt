‘8 conxsmcs napos.

U'hatwe have left of his works is so little in keeping
with the high praise bestowed on Nepos by his contem-
poraries and successo-rs that some authorities have sup-
posed that what goes by his name is an abstract or
summary of his original work. As a historiari he is most
inaccurate. Even when he appears to be translating his
authorities almost word for word, as in the accounts of
Themistocles and Pausanias, he cannot follow them faith-

contented themselves with improving on the city Annals,
or with mere lists of magistrates and genealogies. Caelius

with some vigour, if with little elegance of style, a history
of the Punic war, and Lucius Cornelius Sisenna composed

The style of Nepos is, as a rule, extremely simple and
·easy; where it is not so it is that he becomes obscure
from a desire to be brief. He is fond, for instance, of
leaving his readers to supply a subject to a verb from
oehe sense and not from the preceding words, when the
