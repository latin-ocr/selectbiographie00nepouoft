his arrival that turned the tide in favour of Sparta. He began
by winning the confidence of Cyrus the younger, who was
now satrap over Lydia, Cappadocia, and the greater part of
Phrygia. From that time to the end of the war, Cyrus sup-
plied Lysander with all that he required in the way of pay
for his men, and supplies of all kinds, while he refused the
same to Callicratidas, who succeeded Lysander as admiml.
Lysander, for his part, showed a great talent for orgaiiization
by forming clubs in the Spartan interest in the Greek cities
of Asia, and defeated the Athenian fleet in the absence of its
admiral, Alcibiades, off Notium. The death of bis successor,
Callicratidas, at the battle of Arginusae‚ was a great loss, not
merely to Sparta but also to Greece in general.

Callicratidas was not merely brave and capable, but was
one of the few Greeks who thought that the interests of his
own state were connected closely with those of the rest of
Graece. Lysander, on the other hand, put himself first, Sparta
second, and the rest of Greece nowhere. In 4o5 Rc. he again
obtained the command of the Peloponnesian fleet, though
nominally only secretary‚ or second in command, for Spartan
tradition did not allow the same man to be admiral twice.
Though opposed to a very superior force he managed to evade
it, take Lampsacus in the Hellespont‚ and finally capture
nearly the whole Athenian fleet by surprise. at Aegospotanii3
but he disgmced liis victory by killing all his prisoners, where·
as Callicratidas had refused even to sell Greeks into slavery.
He then proceeded to capture the various Athenian posts on
the Aegean, and by forcing the garrisons to go to Athens pared
the way for starving out that city, which was forced to sur-
render in 404 ac. Lysander then established an oligarchy

· there, all power being left in the hands of thirty men, usually
i known as the Thirty Tyrants, just as he had set up elsewhere
governments of ten. He was now the first man in Greece,
and among the Greeks of Asia had altars and statues erected
to him as if he had been a god. But though pleasure and
richen seem to have bad no charnis for him, he was inordinately
ambitione, and did not attempt to disguise his ambition.
ι Moreover, he was supremely arrogant, deceitful, and cruel.
