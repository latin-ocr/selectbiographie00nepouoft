statua in foro Magnesiae. De cuius morte multimodis
apud plerosque scriptum est 3 sed nos eundem potis-
simum Thucydidem auctorem probamus, qui illum ait
Magnesiae morbo mortuum neque negat fuisse famam
venenum sua sponte sumpsisse, cum se, quae regi de
Graecia opprimenda pollicitus esset, praestare posse des-

quoniam legibus non concederetur, quod proditionis esset
damnatus, memoriae prodidit.

III. ARISTIDES.

Nepos tells us pretty well all that we know about Aristides.
To what he says we may add that Aristides was, as one of the
ten generals, in command of his tribe at Marathon (490 ss.c.),
and supported the view of Miltiades that it was desirable to
light as soon as possible. He was archon the following year,
and ostraeized owing to his rivalry with Themistocles in
483 ac. He was recalled from exile 011 the proposal of
Themistocles in 48ss 13.c.‚ after the battle of Thermopylae, and
rejoined his countrymen at Salamis. There it was he who
brought word to Themistocles that the Persians had cut off
the retreat of the Greeks the night before the battle. He
also commanded a force of hoplites which was lauded on the
island of Psyttaleia, to the east of Salamini, and cut to pieces
the Persians who had been stationed there. He ahares with
Pericles the credit of being superior to bribes, a distinction
which apparently no other Athenian statesman of that century
could claim.
