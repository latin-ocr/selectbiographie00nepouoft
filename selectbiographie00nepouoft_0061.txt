HANNIBAL. 57

VIII. HANNIBAL.

Nepos in his account of Hannibal is at once at his best and
his worst. It is much to his credit that he can take an im par-
tial view of the life of the greatest enemy of Rome, when a
brilliant writer like Livy has hardly a good word to say for
·him. On the other haud, as an historical statement it is
worthless‚ being full of inaccuracies and anachronisms He
gives in great detail so comparatively unimportant an en gage-
ment as the sea-fight with Eumenes, while he makes the most
cursory allusions to Hannibal's great victories in Italy.

Hannibal was born in :247 13.c. He took command of the
army in Spain in 221 13.c., captured Saguntum in 219 B.C.‚
and started for Italy in 218 B.C. His first encounter with
the Romans was in a cavalry skirmish near the mouth of the
Rhone, in which some of his Ninnidian horse, not under his
personal command, were worsted by the cavalry of Scipio's
advance guard. On hearing of the nearness of the enemy,
Hannibal pushed on towards the Alps, as he did not wish to
fight the Romans till he reached Italy. After crossing the
Alps he had another cavalry engagement with the consul,
Publius Scipio, on the banks of the Ticinus, in which the
latter, defeated and severely wounded, was only saved hy his
son, afterwards the famous Africanus. Nepos speaks of this
action as having taken place at Clastidium, a place south of
the Padu8‚ containing some Roman magazines, whereas the
Ticinus flows into it from the north.

Hannibal then crossed the Padus and defeated the other
consul, Sempronius, on the Trebia. This victory made him
master of Cisalpine Gaul. The next spring, 217 13.c.‚ he
crossed the Apennines near the western coast of Italy. The
ophthalmia attacked him as he struggled through the marshes
of the Arno on his one surviving elephant. He devastated
Etruria, and marched past Arretium, the position of the
consul Flaminium who followed him, tn) be destroyed by the
ambush at Lake Thrasymene. Thence Hannibal passed
through Umbria, Picenum, and Central Italy into Apulia.
